**Northeastern Marketplace**
<br>

Northeastern Marketplace is a mobile application that connects Northeastern Students who are interested in buying and selling second hand items. <br><br>


**App information** <br>
Students who are moving out of college often want to sell their tables, lights, etc.. Because there is no proper platform a lot of students leave behind many of their things and shift. This will be a place for students in NEU to buy and sell things. The students can communicate within themselves in the app, negotiate rates and meet at a place. Students can also post details about their house in case they are moving out and need to find a roommate. The app will be a platform for students to connect with each other and smoothen the process.<br>
